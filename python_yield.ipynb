    "# The `yield` command in python\n",
    "\n",
    "I always asked myself what exactly `yield` does and what it is about. In particular, I was very confused, since it seemed to me it is used in functions similar to `return` statements, yet it seems to do something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spinning up a quick google search, I ended up with two very good pages about the topic - as usual on [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/) and also on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do). This notebook will be my summary of what I took away from the realpython atricle and the suggested answer on stackoverflow - originally posted by user [e-satis](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9951/e-satis).\n",

    "\n",
    "`yield` is used when we are using a **generator function**. This is a special kind of python function that returns a [**generator object**](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/gen.html). A generator object is similar to an **iterable** (take a look at the python docs glossary[here](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html)), with two important distinctions:\n",
    "- it can only be iterated over **once**\n",
    "- it's values are not stored in the memory before iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes generators extremely useful if we need to iterate over a lot of values that we do not want to store in the memory. Let's have a look at some very simple code!\n",

    "Okay so we saw now that the code is executed **only after calling the `for` loop**. Okay so here is how it works in detail:\n",
    "Once the first `for` is calling the `generator` object that our function returned, it runs the code in said function until it hits the first `yield`, then returns the respective value. Then, each subsequent iteration of our `generator` object will *continue* the function from where we left off until it hits the next `yield` and then returns again the currently computed value of `i*i` and so on. This continues until the `generator` is \"empty\", so basically until our function is completely run and can't hit `yield` again. One can use `yield` in this way either using a loop (like we did with the `for` loop over `range(3)`) or using an `if/else` statement that `yield`s a value when a condition is `True` or `False`. This allows you to use `generator` objects in very smart and versatile ways."

However the *execution* of our code will typically be always faster when using lists compared to a generator-based approach, so we should not use generators if we are **computation power limited**.\n",
